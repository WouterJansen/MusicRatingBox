# Music Rating Box
This project for the University of Antwerp, was about creating a IoT platform to allow a music artist at a live event to get feedback about the songs through an app/device that each attendee holds.
This git includes the prototype android application that each attendee will have. It receives information about the current song over a MQTT subscription and sends the votes as well over MQTT publish to the back end systems.

# What can be found in this Git?
This git has the source Android Studio project for the android application.
